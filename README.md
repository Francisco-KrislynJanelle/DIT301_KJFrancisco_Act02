# ACTIVITY 2 

1. When I switched between screens or minimized the app, I saw that the log showed different lifecycle methods like onPause, onStop, and onResume.
   It means the app goes through different stages depending on what I’m doing, like opening another screen or leaving the app.

3. I learned that activity management in Android controls how each screen works and changes state. It helps the app handle memory and user actions properly,
   so it doesn’t crash or lose data when switching or minimizing.
